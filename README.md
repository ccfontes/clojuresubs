## jimakusupa

Jimakusupa is a fork from [clojuresubs](https://github.com/tigr42/clojuresubs) wrapping [subtitleConverter](https://github.com/JDaren/subtitleConverter) for some
features that clojuresubs doesn't support. If you want
to process subtitle files in ClojureScript use clojuresubs instead.

### Install
[![clojars version](https://clojars.org/jimakusupa/latest-version.svg?raw=true)](https://clojars.org/jimakusupa)

### Usage
```clj
user=> (:use jimakusupa.core)
user=> (def subs "1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
Altocumulus clouds occur between six thousand

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,800
and twenty thousand feet above ground level.")
user=> (-> (parse :srt subs) (shift 1000) serialize-subrip print) ; miliseconds
user=> (-> (parse :ssa subs) serialize-subrip print) ; supports only serialize to subrip yet
```

### Goals
1. Wrap subtitleconvert for everything that clojuresubs doesn't
support.
2. The wrapped forms will be gradually replaced with Clojure implementations,
until subtitleconvert is completely removed.
3. Finally, jimakusupa will be ported to ClojureScript

### Features
- Read and write SubRip (``*.srt``) files
- Shift by given amount of time
- Read SubStation Alpha (``*.ass``, ``*.ssa``) files

### Wishlist
- Write SubStation Alpha (``*.ass``, ``*.ssa``) files
- Port to ClojureScript
